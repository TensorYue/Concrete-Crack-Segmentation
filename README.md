# Concrete-Crack-Segmentation

This is a two-phase project where the improvement has been made upon the implementation of U-Net in phase 1.

## Phase 1 - Implementation of U-Net on Concrete Crack Segmentation

## Abstract
Comparison between Traditional U-Net and Inception U-Net while training on biased dataset. For the detailed instruction, please view Instruction.ppt.
